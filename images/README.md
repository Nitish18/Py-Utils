## Script to reduce Image size using python

During uploading of Profile Picture at various sites like facebook, Github,
etc., we all have sometimes faced the issue of Image Size Exceded (please
reduce the size of Image). The script under reduce_size.py reduces the size
of images significantly (less than 1 MB) using PIL (Python Image Library)
in a very easy way.

### Requirements

PIL (pillow) library should be installed (it can be installed for both Windows
and Linux from this link http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)


### Usage

Follow the Steps to use this Script:

1. Run the script reduce_size.py
2. Enter the complete image path in the prompt and press enter.
3. That's it. A new file named Compressed_Image.jpg/png will be created
   in the same folder as that of original image with reduced size.
